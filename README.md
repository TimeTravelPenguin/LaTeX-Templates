# LaTeX Templates

This is a small few templates I use for university assessments.

`*.sty` files are packages containing my commonly used commands, and import my regularly used packages.  
`*.cwl` files provide auto completion to IDEs.

None of these packages are designed to be perfect or with the intention of use by others. They are provided as is and may change over time to fit my personal needs.
